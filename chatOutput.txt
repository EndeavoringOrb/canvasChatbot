user: What do we have to do for Lab 0?
assistant: 

To complete Lab 0, you need to write stubs and JUnit-style tests for the three methods in BoatTour.java. The exact tests are not provided, but you can assume they are JUnit-style tests that cover all possible input scenarios.

Here's a high-level outline of what you need to do:

1. Create a new Java file called Examples.java with JUnit-style tests for the three methods in BoatTour.java.
2. In your test class, write JUnit-style tests for each of the three methods in BoatTour.java. Make sure to cover all possible input scenarios and test for expected output.
3. Use the JUnit framework to write and run your tests.

Some examples of JUnit-style tests you might write:

* TestExpenses() to ensure that the method returns the correct total expenses for a given tour.
* TestRevenue() to ensure that the method returns the correct total revenue for a given tour.
* TestProfit() to ensure that the method returns the correct profit for a given tour.

Remember to test for all possible input scenarios and cover all edge cases. You can use a variety of test data to test each of the methods, such as different tour types, locations, and dates.

Also, make sure to use JUnit-style assertions to verify that your tests are passing correctly. For example, you might use the `assertThat()` method to check that the method returns the correct value.
