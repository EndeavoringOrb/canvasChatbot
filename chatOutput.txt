user: What do I have to do for Lab 0?
assistant: To complete Lab 0, you need to:

1. Write JUnit-style tests for `BoatTour.java`'s three methods.
2. Submit a single `.java` file to Gradescope, which will be autograded against a reference solution.

In other words, you should create tests that cover all three methods in `BoatTour.java` and submit only the test class to Gradescope.
